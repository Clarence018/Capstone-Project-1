<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a Loan Processor in the Australian Mortgage industry for 5 years with a passion for learning. 
  I aspire to be a programmer and my journey started with Udemy's course on Web Development by Dr. Angela Yu.
</p>
<p>This is my first Capstone project which is building my resume by using HTML. The method of actively learning is fun and efficient as I enjoy doing this small project and also absorbing a lot of information on the get go.</p>
<p>I hope that I can look back on this someday as I start my first job as a Junior Web Developer.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this part!</p>
